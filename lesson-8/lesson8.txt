//using docker scratch, most basic base image you start from

most lightweight image is scratch. Even lacks bin/sh

//explaining run.bat
line 5: Run go compile out of container and generate a binary file volume mapped to windows machine

create an image which is in the "Dockerfile". 
which copies the binary to the root of the container












TIPS:

remove networks you dont need "docker network prune"

force remove "docker rm -f <first 2 digits of name>"

standard cleaning of images is:
docker rm -f <container ID>
docker rmi <image  name>
docker network prune

find docker networks "docker network ls"

bind a network to image:
docker run -it --rm --network <name> ubuntu /bin/bash

default ubuntu image lacks ping(lol)
